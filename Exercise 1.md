=========

## 1 - Theres no feedback for the progress bar in the Main Page

When user perform an annotation the progress bar change but isn't possible to know the percent of the progress. Adding a
progress more intuitive we can fix this problem and perform a better interaction.


Example of an intuitive progress bar

## 2 - After finish all the annotations progress bar change to "Done"

To keep always the same standard in the aplication the progress bar must continuous with the format without change to "Done", performing only a change of color when its in 100%.


## 3 - All colors of the severities should be diferent, not only blue 

Currently the Annotation Guideline explain that the Severities appears in blue tonality (lighter blue= Minor severity, darker blue= Major
severity, and darkest blue = Critical severity). But to allow a better view is necessary to have a difference in the colors using for example Green for Minor Severity, Yellow for Major severity and Red for a critical Severity. 


## 4 - The usability of the fluency bar must be improved

When user open the Annotation Guideline is explained what to do after review all annotations, but the usability that is shown is not ok. IS possible to creat a new interface for this progress, like using five stars and some questions to user respond with "YEs" Or "No": 
Examples of questions: "Do you consider the text translator a good professional?"

All this question will help Unbabel to select better professionals and detect possible problems with the translators.

## 5 - There's no explanation about the count time that appears in the Annotation Tools

A Guideline must contain all the necessary infomrations for user know how to perform the work in a better way. Implement this information can help user utilize his time correctly.

## 6 - There's no explanation when user report an Annotation
