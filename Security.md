## [01] Insufficient Anti-automation
    
      Application login forms â€“ attackers may automate brute force login requests in an attempt to guess user credentials.


### Form to prevent this issue

      A common practice for protecting against automation attacks is the implementation of CAPTCHA mechanisms in web applications. 
    
### Common CAPTCHA mechanisms may include:

      Distorted text inside images, where the user has to type the text
      Simple math questions such as: "How much is 2+2?"
      Audio CAPTCHA, where the user has to type the word that is played
      Common sense questions such as: "What is the capital city of Australia?"
